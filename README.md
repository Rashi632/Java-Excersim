1) RNA Problem

Instructions
Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

G -> C
C -> G
T -> A
A -> U



2) Pythogorean Triplet


A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,

a**2 + b**2 = c**2
and such that,

a < b < c
For example,

3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.
Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which a + b + c = N.

For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000: {200, 375, 425}.
